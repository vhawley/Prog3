The server directory contains myftpd.c and a makefile for building it.
The client directory contains myftp.c and a makefile for building it as
well. The program4 directory contains the server directory, the client directory
and this README file.

To start the server run the command: "./myftpd 41008" on student03.cse.nd.edu

To start the client run the command: "./myftp student03.cse.nd.edu 41008"

Note that the machine that the server runs on need not be student03.cse.nd.edu,
but if it is a different machine then the client's run command must reflect this
by having that machine's name as the second argument.
